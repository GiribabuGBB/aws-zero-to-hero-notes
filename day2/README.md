# Identity and access management in AWS

## What is identity and access management?
On AWS, authentication and authorization are primarily handled by Identity and Access Management (IAM).With the help of IAM, we can create users, groups, roles. Identities are controlled by attaching policies that precisely define what level of permission they have with all the resources in AWS account.

By default, root has full rights over all the services and resources associated with your account. AWS recommends that you heavily protect your root account and delegate specific powers for day-to-day operations to other users.
